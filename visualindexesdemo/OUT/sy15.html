No problem at all. I fully understand.<br />
<br />
The only glitch is that I will be in Europe next week, leaving this Friday<br />
and coming back next Sunday. I'm visiting several companies and universities.<br />
Is it an option for you to schedule your visit to Poppleton the first week of<br />
November, so that we can get together and talk about the research program<br />
etc. ?<br />
<br />
On another matter now. I have been in contact with Stinson regarding the<br />
program<br />
funds. I am under great pressure from my Department to finalize Giuseppe's<br />
RAship and I am way beyond the deadwildee. I understand that Paul Radfield<br />
will fund the project and Stinson is doing anything he can to make this<br />
happen.<br />
<br />
May I solicit your help and intervention to Paul to have the process<br />
expedited?<br />
I look bad to my colleagues here for not honoring my commitments to the<br />
students<br />
I had promised to support and the pressure on me is mounting exponentially!<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
