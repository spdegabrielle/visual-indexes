Dear Vince,<br />
<br />
this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us<br />
on May 4th.<br />
<br />
I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my<br />
assistant, Carol Lovell, I will ask her to get in touch with Shirley for<br />
scheduwildeg as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to<br />
meet with Christie Stephens as well.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to meeting you,<br />
<br />
Susan<br />
