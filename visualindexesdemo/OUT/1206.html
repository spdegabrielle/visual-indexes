I have managed to change my ticket and we can meet for dinner on Sunday <br />
10/15/00.<br />
Shall we say at 7pm?<br />
<br />
>>>>Giuseppe: Can you please join us for dinner on Sunday 10/15. We'd like to <br />
briefly<br />
discuss the project too. Could I please ask you to make reservations for 3 at<br />
Il Fornaio or some other nice place in Palo Alto? Preferably a quiet place <br />
where<br />
we can talk.<<<<<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
