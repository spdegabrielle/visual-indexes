All other things equal, I would prefer March 2nd as the following Friday is <br />
the beginning of spring break for HISD.   Can you check with Radfield and <br />
Fallon?<br />

Hi Stinson,<br />
<br />
Eventually, the team here (Giuseppe, Eric, myself) has converged to two<br />
possible dates to propose for a visit:<br />
<br />
1) Friday, March 2<br />
2) Friday, March 9<br />
<br />
How do these look on your side?<br />
<br />
We'll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing you again.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
Nick<br />
