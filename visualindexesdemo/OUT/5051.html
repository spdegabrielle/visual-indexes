Vince asked me to coordinate the planning for you August visit to Enron.   <br />
Vince and I are free almost any date except August 14 and 15th,  but we would <br />
like to try and schedule your visit at a time when you could meet with other <br />
key EBS executives such as Kevin Hannon and perhaps Ken Rice and John <br />
Echols.    If you could send me a few of your preferred choices of dates, I <br />
will try to optimize getting you on the calendars of these individuals.   <br />
<br />
By the way, Giuseppe is doing a great job and has already made a very good <br />
impression on everyone he has worked with.  It's been a real pleasure having <br />
him here for the summer.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Stinson
