I agree  e-mail is much easier.<br />
<br />
There is a two-hour time difference between Calif and Texas, i.e., 1:00 pm <br />
Texas Time - 11:00 am Calif time.<br />
<br />
Would tomorrow at 11:00 am Calif time be ok with you (1:00 pm Texas)?  <br />
This time is fine for Vince, Tom Cunlife and Stinson Zhang.<br />
<br />
Can they call you and if so, what number?<br />
<br />
Please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

Shirley,<br />
<br />
It's easier to communcate by e-mail, since I am moving from<br />
meeting to meeting (but I have the laptop always with me).<br />
<br />
Please give me a phone number that I could call tomorrow.<br />
What is the time difference between California and your<br />
location? I think it's 2 hours (CA->TX) - is that right?<br />
<br />
I can do the conference call any time from 9-11 CA time.<br />
Would that be OK on your side?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
