<br />
Hope you had a nice Christmas.  Best wishes for the New Year.   <br />
<br />
It would certainly be great to see you and to meet Eric some time in the next <br />
few months.     Everyone here<br />
was very impressed with Giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your <br />
students come to Enron.<br />
<br />
Enron Broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely on <br />
Enron's trading expertise while trying to<br />
minimize our role as an engineering company and innovator of technology.   I <br />
spoke recently with Jim Fallon, the current<br />
head trader in EBS, and we put together a short list of topics of interest <br />
where you might be able to help educate us.<br />
I put these in the order of interest (to Mr. Fallon).<br />
<br />
1.   Where will bandwidth prices go?   The direction of prices, obviously is <br />
the concern of any trader.   We realize that <br />
technological innovation will continue to drive down prices, but are still <br />
interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall,  <br />
if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where you <br />
could see prices stable or rising for some length of time,  <br />
if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious <br />
amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing, <br />
and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect on <br />
prices of new technologies.<br />
 The term "bandwidth" might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity, but could <br />
also incompass dark fiber, or IP transit and transport <br />
pricing.<br />
<br />
2.  During the last year, Enron purchased a company known as "Warpspeed" in <br />
order to acquire their MetaRouter technology.   To quote from the Enron press <br />
release:<br />
<br />
"MetaRouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the <br />
optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in <br />
the world. Capable of processing thousands of connections per second, <br />
MetaRouter significantly enhances Enron,s ability to automate circuit <br />
provisioning."<br />
<br />
There may be two separate questions to ask here.   First,  in the context of <br />
the current market (or the market which may develop in the next 1-2 years), <br />
will the MetaRouter be a commercially viable product?   That is,  will it <br />
address an actual need in the market, or would it be more cost effective just <br />
to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits?<br />
<br />
The second question (our first real technical question):  is the MetaRouter <br />
technology scalable?     Before starting on this project, Vince and I will <br />
need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are <br />
implementing this technology.<br />
<br />
3.  Aggregation of loads.   A recurring question comes from a number of areas <br />
such as IP, network storage, and   streaming media transport sales:  What <br />
value can I get form aggregating customers, each of which has some type of <br />
stochastic load profile?   Giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to <br />
IP transport, but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail.    <br />
The main stumbwildeg block may be that we currently have basically no actual <br />
customer data.   I am told that in a few months we will have some more useful <br />
history.   My understanding is that what will be available will be 5-minute <br />
averages of usage, so we still will not know on a short time scale what the <br />
distribution of load looks like.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our <br />
concerns are at this point.   Please let me know your thoughts about these <br />
topics.   I would expect, for instance that question number 1 may not be <br />
reasonable as a research project, but might be a question which you would <br />
feel comfortable in addressing by giving us  your qualitative opinions, maybe <br />
in the form of a talk here at Enron.    <br />
<br />
<br />
Again,  let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to seeing you again <br />
soon.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hello Vince and Stinson,<br />
<br />
First of all,<br />
<br />
BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!<br />
<br />
If you are in the Poppleton area during the holidays, let's get together<br />
some time to have dinner.<br />
<br />
I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding<br />
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is<br />
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!<br />
<br />
We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would<br />
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into<br />
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the <br />
student<br />
to develop a realistic vision about their research.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,<br />
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of <br />
course<br />
you could visit us before that too.<br />
<br />
<br />
With my WARMEST WISHES,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
