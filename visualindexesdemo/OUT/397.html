<br />
How are you? Hope all is well.<br />
<br />
Eric tells me he had a very productive summer at Enron and was exposed<br />
to several ideas that have shaped his research agenda, both in<br />
the pricing and trading space and in the telecom one.<br />
<br />
I need to support him and a new student I am bringing aboard on this<br />
project for this quarter and the academic year, and I would like to see<br />
how  we can move ahead with this year's funding for this project. I<br />
understand that EBS has had some problems, but we are wilwildeg to expand<br />
our research agenda to match the current needs and foci at EBS or other<br />
groups. Eric broughtback from Enron a couple of very interesting research<br />
problems that he/we is/are focusing on now.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how we can proceed. I'm under some pressure by the<br />
Department to move ahead with finalizing the research assistanships.<br />
<br />
I look forward to see you again at Poppleton or Enron.<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
Nick
