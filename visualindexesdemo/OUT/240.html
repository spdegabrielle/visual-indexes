<br />
I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Theo) for 15 - <br />
30 minutes<br />
to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.<br />
A separate message about  this visit will follow.<br />
<br />
I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships <br />
with<br />
different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of<br />
the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our <br />
presence<br />
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.<br />
<br />
We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get <br />
the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we <br />
are not<br />
very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses<br />
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:<br />
<br />
1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  <br />
underwriting two research<br />
projects at Poppleton University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  <br />
Nicholas Jones<br />
(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation<br />
of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.<br />
Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain <br />
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and <br />
also to lock-up some very<br />
promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such <br />
programs.<br />
<br />
2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every <br />
presentation<br />
I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes <br />
and hiring decisions.<br />
It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic <br />
program. In many cases,<br />
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach <br />
them during their <br />
senior years.<br />
<br />
3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. <br />
<br />
Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to <br />
getting the best students<br />
and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important <br />
in shaping public  opinion<br />
on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of <br />
deregulation and design of new markets).<br />
<br />
Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on <br />
personal commitment of a number<br />
of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and <br />
focus.<br />
<br />
I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) <br />
responsible for coordinating<br />
our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from <br />
our Analyst/Associate<br />
program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.<br />
