Thanks a lot. I would appreciate if you could set up a meeting with Prof. <br />
Jones.<br />
We talked to him during our last visit and we would like to follow up with <br />
some <br />
specific proposals regarding research projects Enron could sponsor.<br />

Dr. Smith, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and <br />
me<br />
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing <br />
short<br />
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the <br />
people,<br />
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in<br />
Poppleton during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next<br />
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Jones.<br />
All the best wishes,<br />
<br />
Giuseppe<br />
<br />
<br />
