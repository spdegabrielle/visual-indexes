Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet<br />
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very<br />
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more<br />
clearly.<br />
<br />
We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships <br />
(RA)<br />
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support<br />
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to<br />
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental<br />
requirement.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can<br />
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having<br />
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early<br />
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,<br />
just before school starts.<br />
<br />
I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous<br />
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Poppleton. Please,<br />
let me know how you would like to proceed.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive <br />
collaboration<br />
during the coming year and beyond.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area<br />
in October.<br />
<br />
