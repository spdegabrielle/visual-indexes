Vince,

Unfortunately, the faculty club is closed on Saturday.

>>>Lorrie, could you please make reservations
for 2 at, say, Spieto's.<<<<

I am looking forward to seeing you on Saturday. Shall
we meet at the Terman ground floor lobby at 11:45?
I think the Packard building is locked on Saturday.

Thanks,

Nick
