 Nick,

 I hope things are going well and you are not staying too busy.  We should
 start planning for your next trip to Houston, as I'm sure your schedule
 will be getting full very soon.     Perhaps you could give the people in
 Enron Broadband an overview of the areas of interest within your research
 group.   I'm sure we could also benefit from you views of how the current
 technology is evolving.

 Are there certain dates which would potentially work for you?   Please let
 me know by email  or give me a call at 713 853 4748.

 Looking forward to talking with you.
