 Nick,

 I spoke with Paul Racicot, head of trading for  EBS, North America this
 morning.   He said that he is happy to send the $100,000 for your program
 from his budget.   I have forwarded to him the draft letter to accompany
 the funds and will try to follow up to make sure that the money is sent
 promptly.
