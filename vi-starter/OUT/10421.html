<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
strategic relationship with Nick Bambos and his research effort.  Tom is very <br />
excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check.  I suggested that we <br />
have more of a strategic relationship in mine (Enron / Stanford) and he <br />
agreed to that as well.  Tom mentioned that Greg Whalley was interested in <br />
estabilishing such a relationship.  Vince, could you follow this up and <br />
ground this? If you need any help in doing the leg work, I'll happy to do <br />
that.  <br />
<br />
Tom is excited about EBS research's role to support all of EBS including <br />
bandwidth trading. He seems very interested in being our sponsor on the EBS <br />
side. That would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior <br />
management decision through Kevin Hannon.  Vince, I would suggest that you <br />
try to setup a meeting with Kevin Hannon and Tom to discuss this further.  <br />
Tom is also very interested in the New Product development effort that Larry <br />
and I have been kicking around for some time.  He wanted us to sit back and <br />
think of structured products with better margins that Blend & Extend that <br />
they are selling. He wanted to know now much more resource that we need in <br />
that front.  For this, I would like to get someone like Meera Natarajan. She <br />
is an originator currently working in EES and have talked to Zimin and <br />
Stinson. She is sufficiently analytical with commercial mind set to help with <br />
new product ideas and to ground them.<br />
