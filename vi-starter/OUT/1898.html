Hi Vince,<br />
<br />
I am on the technical program committee of the Infocom 2001 conference,<br />
and we are meeting in New York City on Saturday, October 14th, to select<br />
papers for the conference program. I'm leaving Stanford on Friday and<br />
getting back on Sunday.<br />
<br />
It might be a possibility to have dinner together on Sunday, if that would<br />
work for you. In that case I would have to reschedule my flight to land<br />
in SFO earlier than I'm currently scheduled to land.<br />
<br />
Would dinner on Sunday work for you? Any chance we can meet Monday for<br />
lunch?<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing you.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
