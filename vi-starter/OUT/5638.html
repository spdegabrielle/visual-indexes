I'm arriving at the George Bush airport in Houston next Thursday at 5:15pm.<br />
I could then take a taxi to the hotel or the restaurant. How long would it<br />
take me to get there? Is there a "rush hour" problem at that time?<br />

<br />
I'm flying out of Houston on Friday at 6:45pm. Is there a rush hour problem<br />
on the freeways at that time? What time should I leave from Enron to be at the<br />
airport at 6pm?<br />
<br />

I hope I'll have opportunities to give talks at Enron in subsequent visits<br />
along the research path. In this first visit I was hoping to understand better<br />
the research goals of Enron and brainstorm with people about what are the<br />
top challenges and opportunities for our research collaboration. Identifying<br />
the best research problems in terms of<br />
1) highest innovation potential and<br />
2) highest projected impact<br />
would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to<br />
talk to an audience that I don't have any prior information about and is<br />
very diverse anyway; it could actually be "dangerous." I would feel MUCH more<br />
comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the <br />
environment<br />
better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a<br />
position to "impress" people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides,<br />
I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped<br />
all next week.)<br />
<br />

I'm swamped, but I'll try to put something together.<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing you next week.<br />
