Hello Vince,<br />
<br />
It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch<br />
we had together. I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the<br />
technical level and otherwise.<br />
<br />
I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for<br />
a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was<br />
clearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -<br />
mine is rather terrible:<br />
<br />
Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter<br />
Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron<br />
to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to<br />
visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in<br />
Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.<br />
<br />
Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably<br />
is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within<br />
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this<br />
research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be<br />
important for the student support funds to be in place then, so<br />
that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top<br />
talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have<br />
approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing "soft<br />
commitments to star-level students" to get this research and its<br />
potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought<br />
after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this<br />
competition.<br />
<br />
Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the<br />
project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the<br />
end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can<br />
happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.<br />
I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets<br />
going. Please let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
