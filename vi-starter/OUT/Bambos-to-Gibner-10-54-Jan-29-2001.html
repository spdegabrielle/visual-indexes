Stinson,<br />
<br />
Just a quick note to let you know that I am looking into it,<br />
trying to rearrange a couple of things. I'd like Giuseppe and<br />
possibly Eric to come with me, so I need to coordinate with<br />
them too. We've made some nice progress that I'd like to present<br />
and also integrate Eric in the system.<br />
<br />
I am targeting a Friday around the end of February or begining<br />
of March. I'll let you know soon of a few possibilities as they<br />
stabilize here.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
<br />
