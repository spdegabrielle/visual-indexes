><br />
>Dear Dr. Kaminski,<br />
><br />
>Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations<br />
>for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am<br />
>always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies<br />
>that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.<br />
><br />
>I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with<br />
>Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for<br />
>some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip<br />
>to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the<br />
>university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to<br />
>include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,<br />
>May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip<br />
>planning.<br />
><br />
>The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship<br />
>between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities<br />
>in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best<br />
>points of contact.<br />
><br />
>I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,<br />
><br />
>Sincerely,<br />
