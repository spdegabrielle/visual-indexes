<br />
Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a<br />
very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very<br />
informative.<br />
<br />
As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below<br />
a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program<br />
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.<br />
It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was<br />
and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.<br />
<br />
If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,<br />
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize<br />
the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,<br />
who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate<br />
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest<br />
to Enron.  The plan is this:<br />
<br />
1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months<br />
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem<br />
space.<br />
<br />
2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of<br />
good problems of:<br />
a) high practical importance<br />
b) high innovation potential<br />
c) serious scope.<br />
<br />
3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:<br />
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback<br />
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact<br />
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy<br />
and execution path.<br />
<br />
I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so<br />
that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his<br />
doctoral work in this area.<br />
<br />
I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of<br />
starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these<br />
research issues!<br />
<br />
Talk to you soon.<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
