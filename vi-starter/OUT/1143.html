Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays<br />
and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford.<br />
I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's<br />
plan to meet for dinner then.<br />
<br />
I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research  <br />
project.<br />
We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project<br />
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.<br />
It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection<br />
of the research topics.<br />
<br />
We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.<br />
Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall <br />
welcome him with open arms.<br />
<br />
I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the <br />
arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.<br />

<br />
Hello Vince and Stinson,<br />
<br />
First of all,<br />
<br />
BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!<br />
<br />
If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together<br />
some time to have dinner.<br />
<br />
I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding<br />
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is<br />
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!<br />
<br />
We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would<br />
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into<br />
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the <br />
student<br />
to develop a realistic vision about their research.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,<br />
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of <br />
course<br />
you could visit us before that too.<br />
<br />
<br />
With my WARMEST WISHES,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
<br />
