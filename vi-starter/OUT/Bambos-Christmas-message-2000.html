First of all,<br />
<br />
BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!<br />
<br />
If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together<br />
some time to have dinner.<br />
<br />
I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding<br />
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is<br />
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!<br />
<br />
We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would<br />
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into<br />
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the <br />
student<br />
to develop a realistic vision about their research.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,<br />
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of <br />
course<br />
you could visit us before that too.<br />
<br />
<br />
With my WARMEST WISHES,<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
<br />
