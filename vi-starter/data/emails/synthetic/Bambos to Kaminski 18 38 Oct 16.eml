Vince,

No problem at all. I fully understand.

The only glitch is that I will be in Europe next week, leaving this Friday
and coming back next Sunday. I'm visiting several companies and universities.
Is it an option for you to schedule your visit to Stanford the first week of
November, so that we can get together and talk about the research program
etc. ?

On another matter now. I have been in contact with Stinson regarding the
program
funds. I am under great pressure from my Department to finalize Giuseppe's
RAship and I am way beyond the deadline. I understand that Paul Racicot
will fund the project and Stinson is doing anything he can to make this
happen.

May I solicit your help and intervention to Paul to have the process
expedited?
I look bad to my colleagues here for not honoring my commitments to the
students
I had promised to support and the pressure on me is mounting exponentially!

Many Thanks,

Nick
