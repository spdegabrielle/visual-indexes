Hi Stinson,

Eventually, the team here (Giuseppe, Eric, myself) has converged to two
possible dates to propose for a visit:

1) Friday, March 2
2) Friday, March 9

How do these look on your side?

We'll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.

I look forward to seeing you again.

Best,
Nick
