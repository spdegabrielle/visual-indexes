Hello Professor Bambos,
        I was talking to some friends I have at Enron about pricing
options for bandwidth trading and other optimization algorithms for
broadband networks. Anyway they are interested in talking to you about
your research. They will be in town next week tuesday and wednesday and
would appreciate getting a chance to talk to you. Are you available?
Thanks,
       Brad
